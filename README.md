# Work Day Scheduler

## Description 

Everybody's got a million things to do all at once. If only we had a way to help us keep trak of our day on our computers
as we get through task afer task. We've heard the need, and we have brought you the Work Day Scheduler!

Just go ahead and load it up and give it a try! Go ahead and type in your tasks throughout your workday and hit the blue save button.

If your task is due presently, your block will turn red to let you know you've got to get to it! Your future tasks are green, you've got some time.

The application is deployed at 
(https://clayto30.github.io/work-day-scheduler/).

## Credits

UCB Extension Coding Bootcamp designed this challenge for me to demonstrate what I have learned using 3rd party API's like Bootstrap and
jQuery. The Coding Bootcamp provided the mockup, starter code, and the funtionality that I tried to accomplish. 

My TA, Mason McGinley, provided assistance.
